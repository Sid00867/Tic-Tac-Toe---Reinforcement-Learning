# Tic-Tac-Toe---Reinforcement-Learning
An AI bot for Tic-Tac-Toe that models the game as a Markov Decision Process and solves it via value iteration, integrating minimax principles for robust adversarial play. Beyond simple rule-based bots, this project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can employed in turn based games
